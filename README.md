        Hello friends!
 Nice to meet and share with you here!
 My name is Tung Duong;  48 years old.
I am living in Ha Noi, Viet nam. 
 I am a Journalist, someone who has 25 years of writing and participates in the work of a cultural researcher.
 I both write articles and research.
 Besides the flow of events and events of journalism, I am very interested, learn and share issues about the traditional culture of the nations.
  I graduated from Hanoi Cultural University with a Major in Cultural Heritage.  Therefore, topics on cultural heritages, the work of preserving, exploiting and promoting the value of historical and cultural relics, heritage treasures, especially antiques of Vietnam and China,  ...
 I join most of the typical Groups of Antiquities and cultural heritages in Vietnam.  And I am also forming my own team pages, or I create, manage and build a development direction according to my ideas.
 I would be happy to have your help so that I can develop my communities with good intentions.
 It would be nice if you could visit these playgrounds of mine.
 Thank you all!

 I joined in a bit late for many reasons, including my language barrier and my poor access to the Internet!
